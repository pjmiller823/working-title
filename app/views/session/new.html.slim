        p Working Title is an app built for professional and amateur writing groups. Most writing groups are forced to contend with the constant application sprawl, emailing their stories, receiving multiple emails back, a web forum on one page, etc. Working Title allows each writing group to have their own dedicated and private space where they can post their work and view all critiques on a single page. In addition, the author's previous submissions will be tracked on the site so you can view their growth over time.
